Overview
This README provides instructions on how to load, explore, clean, visualize, and analyze a dataset using R. The dataset is read from an Excel file and contains information about subjects, their MRI data, and various demographic and health-related variables.

Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following packages installed in R:

readxl
ggplot2
dplyr
summarytools
Install them if you don't have them already using the following commands:


install.packages("readxl")
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("summarytools")
Steps
1. Load the Dataset
Load the dataset from an Excel file using the read_excel function from the readxl package.


# Load the dataset
df <- read_excel(file_path)
2. View the First Few Rows of the Dataset
Check the first few rows to get an idea of the structure and content of the dataset.


# View the first few rows of the dataset
head(df)
3. Explore the Dataset
Use str and summary to understand the structure and summary statistics of the dataset.


# Explore the dataset
str(df)
summary(df)
4. Detailed Summary
Get a detailed summary of the dataset using dfSummary from the summarytools package.


# Detailed summary
dfSummary(df)
5. Data Cleaning
Rename columns for easier reference and remove rows with missing values.


# Data cleaning (if necessary)
colnames(df) <- c("Subject_ID", "MRI_ID", "Group", "Visit", "MR_Delay", "M/F", "Hand", "Age", "EDUC", "SES", "MMSE", "CDR", "eTIV", "nWBV", "ASF")
df <- na.omit(df)
6. Check the Cleaned Dataset
Check the first few rows of the cleaned dataset.


# Check the cleaned dataset
head(df)
7. Data Visualization
Create visualizations to understand the distribution and relationships in the dataset.

Histogram of Age Distribution

# Histogram of Age Distribution
ggplot(df, aes(x = Age)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill = "blue", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Age Distribution", x = "Age", y = "Frequency")
Boxplot of Age by Group

# Boxplot of Age by Group
ggplot(df, aes(x = Group, y = Age, fill = Group)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Boxplot of Age by Group", x = "Group", y = "Age")
Scatter Plot of eTIV vs. nWBV

# Scatter Plot of eTIV vs. nWBV
ggplot(df, aes(x = eTIV, y = nWBV)) +
  geom_point(color = "blue") +
  labs(title = "Scatter Plot of eTIV vs. nWBV", x = "eTIV", y = "nWBV")
8. Statistical Analysis
Perform various statistical analyses to gain insights from the data.

Descriptive Statistics
# Descriptive statistics
summary(df$Age)
summary(df$eTIV)
summary(df$nWBV)
Correlation Analysis
Calculate the correlation between eTIV and nWBV.


# Correlation analysis
cor(df$eTIV, df$nWBV)
Group-wise Summary
Summarize key statistics by group.


# Group-wise summary
df %>% group_by(Group) %>%
  summarise(
    Mean_Age = mean(Age),
    Median_Age = median(Age),
    Mean_eTIV = mean(eTIV),
    Mean_nWBV = mean(nWBV)
  )
Conclusion
By following these steps, you can effectively load, explore, clean, visualize, and analyze your dataset using R. Adjust the code as necessary to fit your specific dataset and analysis needs.
